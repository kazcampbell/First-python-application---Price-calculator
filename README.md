# First-python-application---Price-calculator

This is my first python application. I created a simple price calculator. The objective is simple, you can tweak your budget and item amounts to whatever you would like. Then run the program to see if you have enough $ to complete the transaction while also displaying the remaining balance. I made this from what I have learned so far on CodeAcademy.
